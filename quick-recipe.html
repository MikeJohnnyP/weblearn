            Quick hummus recipe
        </span>

        <p id="qick-recipe">
            This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) </li>
            <li>175g of tahini </li>
            <li>6 sundried tomatoes </li> 
            <li>Half a red pepper </li>
            <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper </li> 
            <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper </li> 
            <li>A dash of olive oil </li> 
        </ul> 

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ul>
           <li>  Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely </li>
           <li>  Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely </li>
           <li>  Add all the ingredients into a food processor </li>
           <li>  Process all the ingredients into a paste. </li>
           <li>  If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time </li>
           <li>  If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time </li>
        </ul> 

        <p>
            For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
        </p>

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        
        <p>
            Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
        </p>
