          <h1> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
          <p>
            Dear Eileen, <br> <br>
            Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part or your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
          </p> 
          <section>
            <h2> Starting dates </h2>
            <p>
              We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginnign of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follows:
              
              <ul>
                <li> First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                <li> Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                <li> Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
              </ul>
              Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br> <br>
              You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on our website.

            <h2> Subject of study </h2>
            <p>
              At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, the ideas you submitted we were moset intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: 

              <ol>
                <li> Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> contructs for representing musical scores</li>
              </ol>
          So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
            </p>

            <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, your are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, i <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:

              <dl>
                <dt>Polynesion chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful"</dd>
                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance, which involved huddling clse together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impercepbly tiny, very rapd movements. One of my fellow students used to sya that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
                <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorer in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being praticed by inhabitans of Northen Alaska an Canada. Later on however it was discorverd that they were jest moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
              </dl>
              For more of my reserach, see my <a href="#">exotic dance reasearch page.</a> <br> <br>
              Your sincerely, <br> <br>
              Dr Eleanor Gaye
